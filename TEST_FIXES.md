# Test Script to Verify All Fixes

## Backend Tests

### 1. Test Backend Health
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/health"
```
Expected: `{"status":"healthy","service":"job-search-api"}`

### 2. Test Resume Parser (should now work without model variable error)
This will be tested when uploading a resume through the frontend.

### 3. Test Protected Endpoints Without Auth
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/information/"
```
Expected: `{"detail":"Not authenticated"}`

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/profile/"
```
Expected: `{"detail":"Not authenticated"}`

## Frontend Tests

### 1. Test Public Pages (should work)
- http://localhost:5173/ (Home)
- http://localhost:5173/about (About)
- http://localhost:5173/signin (Sign In)
- http://localhost:5173/signup (Sign Up)

### 2. Test Protected Pages Without Auth (should redirect to signin)
- http://localhost:5173/dashboard
- http://localhost:5173/personal-info  
- http://localhost:5173/resume-upload
- http://localhost:5173/update-profile

### 3. Test Authentication Flow
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/signup
2. Register a new user
3. Verify OTP
4. Login with credentials
5. Access protected pages (should work)
6. Try uploading a resume (should work without backend model error)

### 4. Test PersonalInfo Page Error Handling
1. Login as a new user
2. Go to http://localhost:5173/personal-info
3. Should NOT show console errors about 404 (should handle gracefully)

## Expected Fixes Verification

✅ **Backend Model Variable Error**: Fixed by renaming local `model` to `gemini_model` in parse_resume_with_gemini()

✅ **Frontend 404 Error on PersonalInfo**: Fixed by adding proper error handling for 404 responses

✅ **Resume Upload Authorization**: Already protected with ProtectedRoute component

✅ **Environment Configuration**: Fixed .env file with proper defaults

## Test Results

After running these tests, all the reported issues should be resolved:

1. ❌ "Failed to parse resume for user 3: Failed to process resume: cannot access local variable 'model'" 
   → ✅ Should be fixed

2. ❌ "GET http://localhost:8000/information/ 404 (Not Found)" with console errors
   → ✅ Should show graceful handling

3. ❌ Unauthorized users accessing resume upload page
   → ✅ Should redirect to signin page
